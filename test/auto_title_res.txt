Ethical principles in decision-making during the COVID-19 pandemic	ethics in medical practice during the covid - 19 pandemic	Abstract In the COVID-19 pandemic, scientific evidence has been produced rapidly to find shortcuts to save lives and return humankind to a safe and normal path. Ethics in human relations and medical practice, rooted in static moral precepts, are challenged by the dynamism of sudden and profound changes in society. In normal times, scientific innovations promise improvements to people's lives. In the context of a pandemic, sharp ethical scrutiny is needed so that no group of people, especially the vulnerable, is harmed. In medicine, the ethical principle guiding good medical practice is to cause no harm. This requires that scientific results be reproduced, reviewed by peers and independent experts, and with conflicts of interest fully declared. By following this and invoking the four ethical principles of necessity, precaution, proportionality, and clarity, scientific information will be valid and public health decisions respected.
Population age structure only partially explains the large number of COVID-19 deaths at the oldest ages	differences in age distribution of covid - 19 among european countries	To date any attention paid to the age shape of COVID-19 deaths has been mostly in relation to attempts to understand the differences in case fatality rates between countries. The aim of this paper is to explore differences in age distribution of deaths from COVID-19 among European countries which have old age structures. We do this by way of a cross-country comparison and put forward some reasons for potential differences.
COVID-19 and Infant Hospitalizations for Seasonal Respiratory Virus Infections, New Zealand, 2020	coronavirus disease control strategies in new zealand	In March 2020, a national elimination strategy for coronavirus disease was introduced in New Zealand. Since then, hospitalizations for lower respiratory tract infection among infants <2 years of age and cases of respiratory syncytial or influenza virus infection have dramatically decreased. These findings indicate additional benefits of coronavirus disease control strategies.
A retrospective analysis of clinical efficacy of ribavirin in adults hospitalized with severe COVID-19	ribavirin in hospitalized patients with covid - 19 : a retrospective study	Introduction Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) swept rapidly throughout the world. So far, no therapeutics have yet proven to be effective. Ribavirin was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 in China because of its in vitro activity. However, evidence supporting its clinical use with good efficacy is still lacking. Methods A total of 208 confirmed severe COVID-19 patients who were hospitalized in Wuhan Union West Campus between 1 February 2020 and 10 March 2020 were enrolled in the retrospective study. Patients were divided into two groups based on the use of ribavirin. The primary endpoint was the time to clinical improvement. The secondary endpoints included mortality, survival time, time to throat swab SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid negative conversion, and the length of hospital stay. Results 68 patients were treated with ribavirin while 140 not. There were no significant between-group differences in demographic characteristics, baseline laboratory test results, treatment, and distribution of ordinal scale scores at enrollment, except for coexisting diseases especially cancer (ribavirin group vs no ribavirin group, P = 0.01). Treatment with ribavirin was not associated with a difference in the time to clinical improvement (P = 0.48, HR = 0.88, 95% CI = 0.63-1.25). There were also no significant differences between-group in SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid negative conversion, mortality, survival time, and the length of hospital stay. Conclusions In hospitalized adult patients with severe COVID-19, no significant benefit was observed with ribavirin treatment.
Cancer care during the COVID-19 pandemic: a perspective from Saudi Arabia	covid - 19 in saudi arabia : a case report	The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continues to disrupt many healthcare settings worldwide including cancer care. COVID-19 has been associated with worse outcomes amongst cancer patients. Saudi Arabia has experienced several Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) outbreaks that affected the continuity of cancer care. In this paper, we describe how Saudi Arabia responded to COVID-19, how cancer care was re-restructured during this pandemic and how the recent MERS-CoV experience may have improved the Saudi response to COVID-19.
The first case of COVID-19 pneumonia in a hemodialysis patient in Japan	hemodialysis therapy during the covid - 19 pandemic	On 31 December 2019, cases of pneumonia whose cause was later identified as SARS-CoV-2 were detected in Wuhan City, Hubei Province of China, and now COVID-19 has spread worldwide. On March 1, 2020, a 69-year-old Japanese man who had been on hemodialysis for 3 years was diagnosed as having COVID-19 pneumonia and hospitalized at our Medical Center. Pulmonary CT revealed bilateral multiple consolidation with bilateral pleural effusion. Aggressive weight reduction was needed to improve the patient’s respiratory condition. Hemodialysis therapy was performed in isolation with hydroxychloroquine administration, but the formation of a dialysis membrane clot forced the withdrawal of dialysis therapy. Changing the dialysis membrane material and anticoagulant enabled the resumption of dialysis therapy, allowing the body weight to correct downward. On the 5th hospitalization day, the patient’s fever dropped and he showed improved oxygenation and chest X-ray. He was eventually discharged. The hydroxychloroquine and appropriate fluid management may have contributed to the patient’s recovery. Clinicians should pay close attention to avoid dialysis-related problems when treating a patient with COVID-19.
Social stigmatisation among COVID-19 patients: addressing a potential source of COVID-19 transmission to healthcare staff in cardiac emergency and cardiac care units	covid - 19 in cardiac unit : a case report	During our routine work, we noticed an increased incidence of COVID-19 diagnoses among patients in the cardiac unit, which led to an exponential increase in COVID-19 cases among hospital staff. We found that patients hid their symptoms from the emergency doctors and attributed those symptoms to cardiac or other causes. Social stigmatisation appeared to be the root cause for hiding their symptoms. Hence, we recommended a strategy to introduce psychological counselling of patients who were suspected to be infected with COVID-19, with a normal cardiac workup to overcome social stigmatisation and save our general wards from COVID-19.
Prediction of amino acid pairs sensitive to mutations in the spike protein from SARS related coronavirus	mutation in spike proteins from sars - cov	In this study, we analyzed the amino acid pairs affected by mutations in two spike proteins from human coronavirus strains 229E and OC43 by means of random analysis in order to gain some insight into the possible mutations in the spike protein from SARS-CoV. The results demonstrate that the randomly unpredictable amino acid pairs are more sensitive to the mutations. The larger is the difference between actual and predicted frequencies, the higher is the chance of mutation occurring. The effect induced by mutations is to reduce the difference between actual and predicted frequencies. The amino acid pairs whose actual frequencies are larger than their predicted frequencies are more likely to be targeted by mutations, whereas the amino acid pairs whose actual frequencies are smaller than their predicted frequencies are more likely to be formed after mutations. These findings are identical to our several recent studies, i.e. the mutations represent a process of degeneration inducing human diseases.
COVID-19 (Coronavirus) Pandemic: Information Sources Channels for the Public Health Awareness	information communication in the context of the pandemic	The main purpose of this paper is to highlight the important information sources of the Public Health awareness used by the library and information sources in this Pandemic situation. Social distancing phase Information professional used a different medium to connect with their patron and try to serve the best manner. The role of the information professional in health information and health literacy is very vital.

In this paper, the researchers provide a brief introduction to different information channel support in information dissemination.
Arterial and venous thromboembolic disease in a patient with COVID-19: A case report	hypercoagulability in patients with covid - 19	• Hypercoagulability is a major contributor to COVID-19 related pulmonary complications; • Commonly used approaches may be insufficient to ameliorate the risk of thromboembolic events in patients with COVID-19; • Even when on thromboprophylaxis, it is crucial to remain vigilant for the occurrence of VTE in patients with COVID-19.
Data Science for Virtual Tourism Using Cutting-Edge Visualizations: Information Geometry and Conformal Mapping	virtual tourism and internet - based experiences with new technologies	We highlight the advantages of virtual tourism and the use of data science to improve existing television and internet-based experiences with new technologies. Information geometry and conformal mappings can improve audiovisual experiences based on drone recordings. The data collection, assimilation, and transformation requirements for a seamless and user-friendly service are discussed along with the precautions to ensure that this technology is used appropriately to protect human safety and the environment.
SARS-CoV-2 infection does not induce HIV viral escape in Central Nervous System: a case series	coinfection with sars - cov - 2 in central nervous system	We report two cases of HIV positive patients with COVID-19 infection and a recent diagnosis of opportunistic infections of central nervous system (CNS). We investigated the potential impact of coinfection with SARS-CoV-2 on HIV replication in CNS.
Case report of a COVID-19-associated myocardial infarction with no obstructive coronary arteries: the mystery of the phantom embolus or local endothelitis	myocardial atherosclerosis in a patient with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus	BACKGROUND: Since the first documented outbreak of a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome inducing Coronavirus in China at the end of 2019 the virus has spread to all continents, leading the WHO to declare a pandemic in March 2020. While this virus primarily targets the alveoli in the lungs, multiple authors have described an increased rate of thrombo-embolic events in affected patients. We present this case of a myocardial infarction with no obstructive coronary atherosclerosis in an otherwise healthy 48-year-old patient. CASE SUMMARY: A 48-year-old female, presenting with chest pain radiating to her left shoulder with no cardiovascular risk factors other than genetic predisposition, was screened for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and tested positive. Although computed tomography angiography excluded obstructive coronary heart disease, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging showed an acute myocardial infarction with no obstructive coronary arteries of the inferior wall. The patient was treated with dual anti-platelet therapy, an angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor and a statin, and assigned to a cardiac rehabilitation program. CONCLUSION: We report a serious thrombo-embolic event during an oligosymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection in a healthy, young patient. While these two diseases may have occurred simultaneously, by chance, it is possible that the pro-thrombotic effects of the SARS-CoV-2 infection facilitated the infarction. This case further demonstrates the significant cardiovascular morbidity potentially caused by SARS-CoV-2.
COVID-19: the vasculature unleashed	endothelial cells and covid - 19 : insights into the role of endothelial cells	On the basis of emerging evidence from patients with COVID-19, we postulate that endothelial cells are essential contributors to the initiation and propagation of severe COVID-19. Here, we discuss current insights into the link between endothelial cells, viral infection and inflammatory changes and propose novel therapeutic strategies.
Neutrophil Extracellular Traps and Their Implications in Cardiovascular and Inflammatory Disease	neutrophil extracellular traps and its role in disease	Neutrophils are primary effector cells of innate immunity and fight infection by phagocytosis and degranulation. Activated neutrophils also release neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) in response to a variety of stimuli. These NETs are net-like complexes composed of cell-free DNA, histones and neutrophil granule proteins. Besides the evolutionarily conserved mechanism to capture and eliminate pathogens, NETs are also associated with pathophysiological processes of various diseases. Here, we elucidate the mechanisms of NET formation and their different implications in disease. We focused on autoinflammatory and cardiovascular disorders as the leading cause of death. Neutrophil extracellular traps are not only present in various cardiovascular diseases but play an essential role in atherosclerotic plaque formation, arterial and venous thrombosis, as well as in the development and progression of abdominal aortic aneurysms. Furthermore, NETosis can be considered as a source of autoantigens and maintains an inflammatory milieu promoting autoimmune diseases. Indeed, there is further need for research into the balance between NET induction, inhibition, and degradation in order to pharmacologically target NETs and their compounds without impairing the patient’s immune defense. This review may be of interest to both basic scientists and clinicians to stimulate translational research and innovative clinical approaches.
Forecasting the dynamics of COVID-19 Pandemic in Top 15 countries in April 2020: ARIMA Model with Machine Learning Approach	trajectories of covid - 19 in the united states of america	We here predicted some trajectories of COVID-19 in the coming days (until April 30, 2020) using the most advanced Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average Model (ARIMA). Our analysis predicted very frightening outcomes, which defines to worsen the conditions in Iran, entire Europe, especially Italy, Spain, and France. While South Korea, after the initial blast, has come to stability, the same goes for the COVID-19 origin country China with more positive recovery cases and confirm to remain stable. The United States of America (USA) will come as a surprise and going to become the epicenter for new cases during the mid-April 2020. Based on our predictions, public health officials should tailor aggressive interventions to grasp the power exponential growth, and rapid infection control measures at hospital levels are urgently needed to curtail the COVID-19 pandemic.
Measuring the missing: greater racial and ethnic disparities in COVID-19 burden after accounting for missing race/ethnicity data	racial / ethnic disparity, and case fatality rates in an urban county	Black, Hispanic, and Indigenous persons in the United States have an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and death from COVID-19, due to persistent social inequities. The magnitude of the disparity is unclear, however, because race/ethnicity information is often missing in surveillance data. In this study, we quantified the burden of SARS-CoV-2 infection, hospitalization, and case fatality rates in an urban county by racial/ethnic group using combined race/ethnicity imputation and quantitative bias-adjustment for misclassification. After bias-adjustment, the magnitude of the absolute racial/ethnic disparity, measured as the difference in infection rates between classified Black and Hispanic persons compared to classified White persons, increased 1.3-fold and 1.6-fold respectively. These results highlight that complete case analyses may underestimate absolute disparities in infection rates. Collecting race/ethnicity information at time of testing is optimal. However, when data are missing, combined imputation and bias-adjustment improves estimates of the racial/ethnic disparities in the COVID-19 burden.
Effective mitigation strategy in early stage of COVID-19 pandemic in China	covid - 19 pandemic in china : a case report	In the past five months, success in control the national epidemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been witnessed in China. The implementation of public health measures accounts for the success which include different interventions in the early or later stages of the outbreak. It is clear that although not all measures were universally effective worldwide, their achievements have been significant. More solidarity is needed to deal with this global pandemic with more learning and understanding. Understanding which of the public health interventions implemented in China were effective may provide ideas for international epidemic control.
COVID-19 presenting as an exanthematic disease: a case report	sars - cov - 2 infection in children with covid - 19	Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is caused by SARS-CoV-2 and has spread rapidly and caused a global pandemic. Knowledge about clinical and laboratory manifestations in the pediatric population is necessary to guide and monitor such patients. A 3-year-old female patient diagnosed with COVID-19 presented with high fever. After defervescence, she experienced a maculopapular rash that worsened by the sixth day of the disease with self-limited evolution without relevant laboratory changes. The identification of rashes in children with COVID-19 is an unusual and important condition that must be recognized in view of the high transmissibility shown.
Anxiety and depression levels among pregnant women with COVID‐19	maternal mental health in pregnancy during the covid - 19 pandemic	We read with great interest the Special Editorial by Dr Thapa and co-authors on the importance of not neglecting emotions of pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic1 as maternal mental health can be associated with short and long term risks for their and their children's physical and psychological health. Most studies on COVID-19 in pregnancy have focused on physical effects of the pandemic on infected mothers as well as the possibility of vertical transmission: these tend to eclipse the equally relevant maternal mental health needs during these unprecedented times.
The forgotten people with thalassemia in the time of COVID-19: South Asian perspective	covid - 19 pandemic : a public health preparedness strategy	South Asia is the hotspot of beta-thalassemia, with an estimated 200,000 patients whose lives depend on regular blood transfusion. Due to COVID-19 pandemic, many countries have adopted unprecedented lockdown to minimize the spread of transmission. Restriction of nationwide human mobility and fear of COVID-19 infection has put thalassemia patients in a life-threatening situation because of an acute shortage of blood supply. As a public health preparedness strategy during a crisis like COVID-19 pandemic, the plights of thalassemia patients should be considered. Government-sponsored community blood-banks needs to be established or coverage expanded as a safety net for the thalassemia patients in lower- and middle-income countries.
Boosted Ensemble Learning for Anomaly Detection in 5G RAN	multi - term memory classifier for detection of a 5g radio access network	The emerging 5G networks promises more throughput, faster, and more reliable services, but as the network complexity and dynamics increases, it becomes more difficult to troubleshoot the systems. Vendors are spending a lot of time and effort on early anomaly detection in their development cycle and majority of the time is spent on manually analyzing system logs. While main research in anomaly detection uses performance metrics, anomaly detection using functional behaviour is still lacking in depth analysis. In this paper we show how a boosted ensemble of Long Short Term Memory classifiers can detect anomalies in the 5G Radio Access Network system logs. Acquiring system logs from a live 5G network is difficult due to confidentiality issues, live network disturbance, and problems to repeat scenarios. Therefore, we perform our evaluation on logs from a 5G test bed that simulate realistic traffic in a city. Our ensemble learns the functional behaviour of an application by training on logs from normal execution time. It can then detect deviations from normal behaviour and also be retrained on false positive cases found during validation. Anomaly detection in RAN shows that our ensemble called BoostLog, outperforms a single LSTM classifier and further testing on HDFS logs confirms that BoostLog also can be used in other domains. Instead of using domain experts to manually analyse system logs, BoostLog can be used by less experienced trouble shooters to automatically detect anomalies faster and more reliable.
Assessment of respiratory droplet transmission during the ophthalmic slit lamp exam: a particle tracking analysis	high - risk aspects of personal protective equipment during the covid - 19 pandemic	Purpose: The global COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a renewed focus on the importance of personal protective equipment (PPE) and other interventions to decrease spread of infectious diseases. While several ophthalmology organizations have released guidance on appropriate PPE for surgical procedures and ophthalmology clinics, there is limited experimental evidence demonstrating the efficacy of various interventions that have been suggested. In this study, we evaluate high-risk aspects of the slit-lamp exam and the effect of various PPE interventions. Design: Experimental cough simulation using a fluorescent surrogate of respiratory droplets during an ophthalmic slit lamp examination. Methods: Setting: Single-center Study Population: Patient Simulation Main outcome measure(s): Presence of fluorescent particles in the air near or on slit lamp and simulated slit lamp examiner. Results: Simulated coughing without a mask or slit lamp shield resulted in widespread dispersion of fluorescent droplets during the model slit lamp examination. Coughing with a mask resulted in the most significant decrease in droplets, however, particles still escaped from the top of the mask. Coughing with the slit lamp shield alone blocked most of forward particle dispersion; however significant distributions of respiratory droplets were found on the slit lamp joystick and table. Coughing with both mask and slit lamp shield resulted in the least dispersion to the simulated examiner. Scanning electron microscopy demonstrated particle sizes of 3-100m. Conclusions: Masking has the greatest effect in limiting spread of respiratory droplets, while slit lamp shields and gloves also contribute to limiting exposure to droplets from SARS-CoV-2 during slit lamp examination.
Calling for rapid development of a safe and effective MERS vaccine	rapid development of a novel coronavirus vaccine against middle east respiratory syndrome	The geographic spread and rapid increase in the cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) caused by a novel coronavirus (MERS-CoV) during the past two months have raised concern about its pandemic potential. Here we call for the rapid development of an effective and safe MERS vaccine to control the spread of MERS-CoV.
COVID-19: Operational Measures from a Surgeon’s Perspective	sars - cov - 2 infection in wuhan, china	Novel corona virus, named as SARS-Cov-2 is the seventh coronavirus causing Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19) in human. It is one of the very few rare events in history of mankind to affect public health at such an enormous scale globally. Whole world is on standstill with this outbreak, which was declared pandemic by WHO in March 2020. All healthcare workers and especially the ones working in vicinity of nasal/oral regions are high risk group to be infected by this airborne virus. Recently, a 62 years old ENT specialist Liang Wudong died while treating patients with COVID in Wuhan city. Numerous reports of health care workers getting infected while serving their patients are coming from all parts of world. As health care providers are struggling to ensure safety and survival of people, their own wellbeing and preventing further spread of infection is also their responsibility. As head and neck surgical specialties are uniquely vulnerable to infection transmission, this communication highlights various instructions and suggestions given by International & National health agencies to safeguard the patient, surgical team, health workers and community. Though the decision regarding treatment is surgeon’s discretion, we hope these guidelines will help in decision making.
The role of the healthcare surface environment in SARS-CoV-2 transmission and potential control measures	sars - cov - 2 and environmental disinfection of covid - 19 in healthcare settings	The healthcare environment serves as one of the possible routes of transmission of epidemiologically important pathogens, but the role of the contaminated environment on SARS-CoV-2 transmission remains unclear. We reviewed survival, contamination, and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 via environmental surfaces and shared medical devices as well as environmental disinfection of COVID-19 in healthcare settings. Coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, have been demonstrated to survive for hours to days on environmental surfaces depending on experimental conditions. The healthcare environment is frequently contaminated with SARS-CoV-2 RNA in most studies but without evidence of viable virus. Although direct exposure to respiratory droplets is the main transmission route of SARS-CoV-2, the contaminated healthcare environment can potentially result in transmission of SARS-CoV-2 as described with other coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. It is important to improve thoroughness of cleaning/disinfection practice in healthcare facilities and select effective disinfectants to decontaminate inanimate surfaces and shared patient care items.
Recent insights into the biological activities and drug delivery systems of tanshinones	pharmacological applications of the chinese medicinal plants	Tanshinones, the major lipid-soluble pharmacological constituents of the Chinese medicinal herb Tanshen (Salvia miltiorrhiza), have attracted growing scientific attention because of the prospective biomedical applications of these compounds. Numerous pharmacological activities, including anti-inflammatory, anticancer, and cardio-cerebrovascular protection activities, are exhibited by the three primary bioactive constituents among the tanshinones, ie, tanshinone I (TNI), tanshinone IIA (TNIIA), and cryptotanshinone (CPT). However, due to their poor solubility and low dissolution rate, the clinical applications of TNI, TNIIA, and CPT are limited. To solve these problems, many studies have focused on loading tanshinones into liposomes, nanoparticles, microemulsions, cyclodextrin inclusions, solid dispersions, and so on. In this review, we aim to offer an updated summary of the biological activities and drug delivery systems of tanshinones to provide a reference for these constituents in clinical applications.
Why do children seem to be more protected against COVID-19? A hypothesis	recurrent covid - 19 exposure to human coronavirus	Today it remains unclear why children seem to be less likely to get infected by COVID-19 or why they appear to be less symptomatic after infections. All individuals, especially children, are exposed to various viruses including human coronavirus (CoVs) that can generally lead to respiratory infections. We hypothesize that recurrent CoVs exposure may induce an effective antiviral B and T-cell-mediated adaptive immune response, which could also be protective against COVID-19. Based on the high-homology between the Spike protein epitopes of taxonomically-related coronaviruses, we theorize that past/recurrent contact with CoVs might shield children also against the circulating COVID-19 through a possible neutralizing antibody response previously CoVs-induced. This would open up possible lines of research for the development of live-attenuated virus vaccines from CoVs. Future research is desirable to confirm or disprove such hypothesis.
Removing barriers and disparities in health: lessons from the COVID-19 pandemic	covid - 19 pandemic : the role of international collaboration	The COVID-19 pandemic has compelled the global community to work together to understand SARS-CoV-2 and mitigate its effects, but it has also highlighted health disparities faced by people from minority racial or ethnic groups and other marginalized populations. International collaboration needs to be leveraged to address these disparities and inequities.
3D-printed suture guide for thoracic and cardiovascular surgery produced during the COVID19 pandemic	design and production of a 3d printed medical device for cardiac surgery during the covid - 19 pandemic	Emergency 3D-printing of medical devices came out as a potential solution to tackle shortages during the COVID-19 pandemic. Manufacturing medical devices in small series within hospital is an exciting perspective in crisis management. Health professionals and additive manufacturing technology are ready for this revolution but regulative adaptations are still required. Here we present the design and production of a suture guide for cardiac surgery as a case study for a 3D printed medical device manufactured during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The COVID-19 pandemic: consequences for nephrology	covid - 19 and kidney disease : a case report	The consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic have been devastating; however, evidence suggests that patients with, or at risk of, kidney disease are disproportionally affected. Patients on dialysis and kidney transplant recipients are at higher risk of adverse outcomes from COVID-19, whereas, conversely, patients with severe COVID-19 are at increased risk of acute kidney injury, with short-term and possibly long-term consequences for nephrological care.
Palliative and end-of-life care in COVID-19 management in sub-Saharan Africa: a matter of concern	palliative and end - of - life care during the covid - 19 pandemic	The COVID-19 pandemic has strained health care systems beyond capacity resulting in many people not having access to life-sustaining measures even in well-resourced countries. Palliative and end-of-life care are therefore essential to alleviate suffering and ensure a continuum of care for patients unlikely to survive. This is challenging in sub-Saharan Africa where lack of trained teams on basic palliative care and reduced access to opioids limit implementation of palliative and end-of-life care. At the same time, health care providers have to cope with local cultural conceptions of death and absence of advance care directives.
An optimised protocol for detection of SARS-COV-2 in stool	detection of sars - cov - 2 in stool samples from individuals free of oral samples	Aim: SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in stool samples of COVID-19 patients, with potential implications for faecal-oral transmission. Compared to swab samples, the complexity of the stool matrix poses a challenge in the detection of the virus that has not yet been solved. The aim of this study was to establish a sensitive and reliable method for detecting SARS-CoV-2 in stool samples. Methods: Stool samples from individuals free of SARS-CoV-2 were homogenised in saline buffer and spiked with a known titre of inactivated virus ranging from 50 to 750 viral particles per 100 mg stool. Debris was removed via centrifugation and supernatants were concentrated by ultrafiltration. RNA was then extracted from the concentrated material using a commercial kit and SARS-CoV-2 was detected via real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) using the CDC primers and probes. Results: The RNA extraction procedure we used allowed the detection of SARS-CoV-2 via RT-qPCR in most of the stool samples tested. We could detect as few as 50 viral particles per 100 mg of stool. However, high variability was observed across samples at low viral titres. The primer set targeting the N1 region provided more reliable and precise results and for this primer set our method had a limit of detection of 1 viral particle per mg of stool. Conclusions: Here we describe a sensitive method for detecting SARS-CoV-2 in stool samples. This method can be used to establish the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 in stool and ensure the safety of clinical practices such as faecal microbiota transplant (FMT).
Ontology-based annotation and analysis of COVID-19 phenotypes	covid - 19 - related clinical phenotypes : a systematic review	The epidemic of COVID-19 has caused an unpredictable and devastated disaster to the public health in different territories around the world. Common phenotypes include fever, cough, shortness of breath, and chills. With more cases investigated, other clinical phenotypes are gradually recognized, for example, loss of smell, and loss of tastes. Compared with discharged or cured patients, severe or died patients often have one or more comorbidities, such as hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. In this study, we systematically collected and analyzed COVID-19-related clinical phenotypes from 70 articles. The commonly occurring 17 phenotypes were classified into different groups based on the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO). Based on the HP classification, we systematically analyze three nervous phenotypes (loss of smell, loss of taste, and headache) and four abdominal phenotypes (nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea) identified in patients, and found that patients from Europe and USA turned to have higher nervous phenotypes and abdominal phenotypes than patients from Asia. A total of 23 comorbidities were found to commonly exist among COVID-19 patients. Patients with these comorbidities such as diabetes and kidney failure had worse outcomes compared with those without these comorbidities.
Nowcasting of COVID-19 confirmed cases: Foundations, trends, and challenges	forecasting of covid - 19 confirmed cases : a case series	The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a public health emergency of international concern affecting more than 200 countries and territories worldwide. As of September 30, 2020, it has caused a pandemic outbreak with more than 33 million confirmed infections and more than 1 million reported deaths worldwide. Several statistical, machine learning, and hybrid models have previously tried to forecast COVID-19 confirmed cases for profoundly affected countries. Due to extreme uncertainty and nonstationarity in the time series data, forecasting of COVID-19 confirmed cases has become a very challenging job. For univariate time series forecasting, there are various statistical and machine learning models available in the literature. But, epidemic forecasting has a dubious track record. Its failures became more prominent due to insufficient data input, flaws in modeling assumptions, high sensitivity of estimates, lack of incorporation of epidemiological features, inadequate past evidence on effects of available interventions, lack of transparency, errors, lack of determinacy, and lack of expertise in crucial disciplines. This chapter focuses on assessing different short-term forecasting models that can forecast the daily COVID-19 cases for various countries. In the form of an empirical study on forecasting accuracy, this chapter provides evidence to show that there is no universal method available that can accurately forecast pandemic data. Still, forecasters' predictions are useful for the effective allocation of healthcare resources and will act as an early-warning system for government policymakers.
Novel Corona Virus 2019 pneumonia in a kidney transplant recipient	covid - 19 pneumonia : a case report	COVID 19 pandemic is spreading worldwide and the impact of the disease in transplant patients is evolving. In this case report, we presented a 63 years old female kidney transplant recipient who presented with dyspnea and cough and diagnosed with COVID 19 pneumonia. On the 4(th) day of admission, the patient’s condition worsened. Therefore, the immunosuppressive medications were discontinued, and hydrocortisone started. The patient died on the 5(th) day.
The role of multidisciplinary infection prevention teams in identifying community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the United States	multidisciplinary infection prevention team in the united states	This case study highlights the role of a multidisciplinary Infection Prevention team in the identification of the first community-transmitted SARS-CoV-2 case at a large, tertiary referral center in the United States. By rounding on the hospital units such teams can serve vital infection prevention, antibiotic stewardship, and disease surveillance functions.
The role of pharmacists and pharmacovigilance after the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic	covid - 19 and pharmacists : a comprehensive review	Pharmacists have had a primary role in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.Not only have they delivered medications to patients, but also they have provided advice to patients about COVID-19 treatment and they have contributed to the COVID-19 screening.The rapid increase in the monitoring process of drugs constitutes a priority during the COVID-19 period, especially for those medications administered as ‘off-label use’ to treat this infection.Currently, there is not enough data to create worldwide guidelines for a controlled and safety use of anti-COVID-19 drugs.Thus, worldwide shared protocols for pharmacists and an increase in pharmacovigilance programs are required in the current COVID-19 period.
Estimate of the Maximum Limit of Total Cases of Infected Patients COVID-19	estimating the number of total cases of covid - 19	In this work, we present a method to estimate the maximum limit of total cases of COVID-19 considering that the time in which the maximum number of new daily cases occurs corresponds to the inflection point of the curve described by the total number of cases that assumed to have a growth according to a logistical function in which the number of total cases at the inflection point will correspond to half of the maximum limit of total cases COVID-19. We estimate this maximum limit for China and South Korea, obtaining results compatible with the observations. And we also estimate for Italy, Germany, United Kingdom, United States and Spain.
Peer teaching medical students during a pandemic	the challenges of peer teaching during the covid - 19 pandemic	Our personal views about the challenges of continuing to deliver peer teaching during a pandemic. We are a group of 4(th) year medical students who are part of a student society which has delivered structured, highly formulaic peer-led teaching sessions for the past three years. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the reduced access to our normal clinical teaching highlighted the importance of peer-led teaching sessions. We wanted to continue with our peer-taught sessions but knew we would have to devise a new format to make our teaching accessible to our peers wherever they were. Here, we describe the challenges of online peer teaching during the COVID-19 pandemic and our reflections of the future implications to our group.
The PULSE Project: A Case of Use of Big Data Uses Toward a Cohomprensive Health Vision of City Well Being	air pollution in adults : a case report	Despite the silent effects sometimes hidden to the major audience, air pollution is becoming one of the most impactful threat to global health. Cities are the places where deaths due to air pollution are concentrated most. In order to correctly address intervention and prevention thus is essential to assest the risk and the impacts of air pollution spatially and temporally inside the urban spaces. PULSE aims to design and build a large-scale data management system enabling real time analytics of health, behaviour and environmental data on air quality. The objective is to reduce the environmental and behavioral risk of chronic disease incidence to allow timely and evidence-driven management of epidemiological episodes linked in particular to two pathologies; asthma and type 2 diabetes in adult populations. developing a policy-making across the domains of health, environment, transport, planning in the PULSE test bed cities.
Current landscape of Imaging and the potential role for Artificial intelligence in the management of COVID-19	chest x - ray radiography and chest x - ray radiography : a review of the literature	The clinical management of COVID-19 is challenging. Medical imaging plays a critical role in the early detection, clinical monitoring and outcomes assessment of this disease. Chest x-ray radiography (CXR) and computed tomography (CT) are the standard imaging modalities used for the structural assessment of the disease status, while functional imaging (namely, positron emission tomography) has had limited application. Artificial intelligence (AI) can enhance the predictive power and utilization of these imaging approaches and new approaches focusing on detection, stratification and prognostication are showing encouraging results. We review the current landscape of these imaging modalities and AI approaches as applied in COVID-19 management.
Survey of AAHKS International Members on the Impact of COVID-19 on Hip and Knee Arthroplasty Practices	covid - 19 pandemic : a survey of international orthopaedic surgeons	Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic poses an important risk to global health. This study surveyed 370 international orthopaedic surgeons affiliated with the American Association of Hip and Knee Surgeons to help identify the global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on patient care. A total of 99 surgeons (27% of those surveyed) completed the questionnaire representing 32 different countries. Except for surgeons in Japan, all respondents noted that their practice had been affected to some degree and 70% of the surgeons have cancelled elective procedures. More than a third of the surgeons have had to close their practices altogether and the remaining open practices were estimated to be sustainable for 7 weeks on average given their current situation. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in marked changes to the majority of international arthroplasty practices.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers may be harmful in patients with diabetes during COVID-19 pandemic	the renin - angiotensin system in patients with diabetes	Abstract The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak once again demonstrated the importance of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in patients with diabetes. Activation of the RAS increases in patients with diabetes. The virus attaches to the ACE2 enzyme at low cytosolic pH values and enters into the cell and causes infection. Especially in the presence of diabetes mellitus and accompanying comorbid conditions such as hypertension, obesity, old age, and smoking, cytosolic pH is low, thus the virus easily may enter the cell by attaching to ACE2. ACEIs and ARBs lead to a reduction in angiotensin II level by increasing the ACE2 level, thus they cause a low cytosolic pH. Increased cardiac ACE2 levels due to ACEIs and ARBs can trigger cardiac arrhythmias and myocarditis by causing the virus to easily enter the heart tissue. There is ACE2 activity in the rostral ventrolateral medulla in the brain stem. The release of angiotensin 1-7 in the brain stem leads to the activation of the sympathetic nervous system. This activation causes systemic vasoconstriction and the patient’s blood pressure increases. The most important event is the increased sympathetic activity via the central stimulation, this activity increases pulmonary capillary leaking, causing the ARDS. As the cytosolic pH, which is already low in patients with diabetes will decrease further with the mechanisms mentioned above, the viral load will increase and the infection will be exacerbated. As a result, the use of ACEIs and ARBs in patients with diabetes can lead to increased morbidity and mortality of COVID-19.
Foot and ankle service adaptation in response to COVID-19 and beyond	covid - 19 pandemic and healthcare delivery : challenges and challenges	The disruption to healthcare provision as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic has compelled us to streamline healthcare delivery. This has given us an opportunity to implement healthcare technology, reform inter-disciplinary collaboration and ultimately enhance patient care. We discuss some of the advances made by the foot and ankle department at our hospital. These innovations have broad applicability and will hopefully ignite discussion amoung a number of healthcare teams about improving the future care of their patients.
Cardiology and COVID-19: do we have sufficient information?	coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid - 19 ) : a narrative review	Novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, which originated in Wuhan (China), transformed into a worldwide pandemic. The short span associated with the spread of the virus and its varied manifestations presents a steep learning curve for many clinicians on the front-line of treatment. Cardiology is one such affected area. This paper details the signs and symptoms of cardiovascular disease resulting from COVID-19, including its proposed pathophysiology, signs and symptoms, treatments and outcomes under investigation. The consensus is that COVID-19 patients with cardiovascular injury have a shorter duration from symptom onset to deterioration, higher mortality and higher prevalence in older populations. Diagnosis and intervention for patients with underlying cardiovascular comorbidities is critical.
False ground-glass opacity and suspicion of COVID-19, beware of the technique for performing the CT	a case report of chest ct for covid - 19	Ground-glass opacity is a CT sign that is currently experiencing renewed interest since it is very common in patients with COVID-19. However, this sign is not specific to any disease. Besides, the possibility of false positive ground-glass opacity related to insufficient inspiration during the acquisition of the chest CT should be known. We report the case of a 36-year-old patient suspected of COVID-19 and in whom a second acquisition of chest CT was necessary to remove false ground-glass opacities that erroneously supported the diagnosis of COVID-19.
The evolving role of family physicians during the coronavirus disease 2019 crisis: An appreciative reflection	the role of family medicine in the covid - 19 crisis	Ten family physicians and family medicine registrars in a South African semi-rural training complex reflected on the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) crisis during their quarterly training complex meeting. The crisis has become the disruptor that is placing pressure on the traditional roles of the family physician. The importance of preventative and promotive care in a community-oriented approach, being a capacity builder and leading the health team as a consultant have assumed new meanings.
Influence of Cigarettes and Alcohol on the Severity and Death of COVID-19: A Multicenter Retrospective Study in Wuhan, China	covid - 19 : a multi - center study	BACKGROUND: The recent emergence and rapid global spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is leading to public health crises worldwide. Alcohol consumption and cigarette smoking (CS) are two known risk factors in many diseases including respiratory infections. METHODS: We performed a multi-center study in the four largest hospitals designated for COVID-19 patients in Wuhan. There are totally 1547 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 enrolled in the study, alcohol consumption and CS history were evaluated among these patients. The epidemiology, laboratory findings and outcomes of patients contracted COVID-19 were further studied. RESULTS: Our findings indicated that COVID-19 patients with a history of CS tend to have more severe outcomes than non-smoking patients. However, alcohol consumption did not reveal significant effects on neither development of severe illness nor death rates in COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSION: CS is a risk factor for developing severe illness and increasing mortality during the SARS-CoV-2 infection. We believe that our findings will provide a better understanding on the effects of alcohol intake and CS exposure in COVID-19 patients.
A First Instagram Dataset on COVID-19	multilingual coronavirus ( covid - 19 ) pandemic : a multilingual covid - 19 dataset	The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic outbreak is drastically shaping and reshaping many aspects of our life, with a huge impact on our social life. In this era of lockdown policies in most of the major cities around the world, we see a huge increase in people and professional engagement in social media. Social media is playing an important role in news propagation as well as keeping people in contact. At the same time, this source is both a blessing and a curse as the coronavirus infodemic has become a major concern, and is already a topic that needs special attention and further research. In this paper, we provide a multilingual coronavirus (COVID-19) Instagram dataset that we have been continuously collected since March 30, 2020. We are making our dataset available to the research community at Github. We believe that this contribution will help the community to better understand the dynamics behind this phenomenon in Instagram, as one of the major social media. This dataset could also help study the propagation of misinformation related to this outbreak.
Error thresholds and the constraints to RNA virus evolution	rna viruses and the emergence of new viruses	RNA viruses are often thought of as possessing almost limitless adaptability as a result of their extreme mutation rates. However, high mutation rates also put a cap on the size of the viral genome by establishing an error threshold, beyond which lethal numbers of deleterious mutations accumulate. Herein, I argue that a lack of genomic space means that RNA viruses will be subject to important evolutionary constraints because specific sequences are required to encode multiple and often conflicting functions. Empirical evidence for these constraints, and how they limit viral adaptability, is now beginning to accumulate. Documenting the constraints to RNA virus evolution has important implications for predicting the emergence of new viruses and for improving therapeutic procedures.
Bridge the Gap: Reducing Inequity in Hospital Readmissions for African American Patients with Heart Failure Through Quality Improvement Initiatives	the role of heart failure in african america : a literature review	Purpose: Heart failure (HF) disproportionately impacts African Americans. We evaluated existing quality improvement (QI) initiatives and patient and provider perceptions of barriers to HF care to develop equity-centered QI recommendations. Methods: We performed a literature review, interviewed providers and patients (N=11), and conducted a root cause analysis at a safety net hospital in San Francisco, California. Results: We have identified four elements to foster a more equitable HF care model: screening for social determinants of health, technological innovation, optimization of space, and implicit bias training. Conclusion: QI initiatives for HF should integrate health equity elements in their design and implementation.
Is SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) postviral olfactory dysfunction (PVOD) different from other PVOD?	postviral olfactory dysfunction : a scoping review	BACKGROUND: The SARS-CoV-2 virus continues to spread rapidly across the globe afflicting many with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). As the infection rates rise, a growing number of SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals have been reported to complain of olfactory disturbances at an alarming rate. Postviral olfactory dysfunction (PVOD) is a well-known phenomenon that may explain the olfactory dysfunction reported by SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals. METHODS: A scoping literature review was performed to identify studies that investigated the mechanisms of postviral olfactory dysfunction. Studies demonstrating pathophysiological, histological, immunochemical, and epidemiological outcomes of PVOD were included. RESULTS: Fourteen studies were included in addition to one international news article. Three studies reported destruction of the olfactory epithelium following intranasal inoculation of various viral strains in mice. Three studies isolated pathogenic, anosmia inciting viruses (Parainfluenza virus, Human Coronavirus, Rhinovirus) through nucleic acid amplification. Eleven studies demonstrated female predilection in patients with PVOD and COVID-19 associated olfactory dysfunction, of which the majority were over 50 years old. CONCLUSIONS: PVOD and COVID-19 associated olfactory dysfunction demonstrates considerable similarities in epidemiological trends and disease sequela of other viruses to suggest identical pathophysiological mechanisms. Further studies such as intranasal inoculation and histological biopsies are needed to support our hypothesis.
The Role of Diet and Supplementation of Natural Products in COVID-19 Prevention	the role of vitamins, vitamins, and micronutrilt status in covid - 19	Recently, a discussion has begun on the global management strategy against COVID-19 based on the hypothesis that individuals’ macro- and micronutrient status combined with antiviral drugs and herbs can be an ally against the infection. The hypothesis is that people’s nutritional and oxidative scavenging capacity may provide fundamental data to predict severe and acute pulmonary distress following SARS-Cov2 infection. Consequently, the scientific community has addressed the role of balanced diets, nutritional supplements, and micronutrients, including folk herbal formulations, in reducing hospitalization and the severity of pulmonary impact in COVID-19 by preventing the most serious forms of the infection. This led to an animated debate on the potential effectiveness of some vitamins, micronutrients, and traditional Chinese medicine in preventing COVID-19, with some authors convinced that plant extracts could act oppositely, exacerbating the effect of the infection. While current research is still far to assess the suggestions and issues raised in this short communication, it is undoubtedly true that determining an individual’s current metabolic status, including macro- and micronutrients, is an essential factor in defining any individuals’ deficiencies, which will need to be addressed urgently through a proper diet, specific personalized nutritional supplementation, and lifestyle changes.
Nanotechnology shows promise for next-generation vaccines in the fight against COVID-19	nanoparticles for vaccine development	COVID-19 is possibly a game changer for nanotechnology. There are currently no licensed DNA and mRNA vaccines; therefore, if any of the COVID-19 candidates are successful, this might be the push nanotechnology needs for vaccine development. DNA, mRNA, and recombinant protein delivered into the targeted host cells to build immunity against the coronavirus would not have been feasible without nanoparticles as a delivery vehicle. Nanoparticles provide the solutions to address the unmet delivery challenges associated with the use of naked DNA plasmids or mRNA for vaccine development. Such solutions provide the ability to deliver DNA plasmids or mRNA vaccine in areas previously unreachable. In addition, nanotechnology-based vaccines are easy to design, synthesize, or scale up in larger volume compared to the traditional vaccine approaches (e.g., inactivated and live-attenuated strains). Nanotechnology thus has great potential to be a vital tool for tackling the COVID-19 outbreak and may be a crucial technology to prevent future infectious disease outbreaks.
Disruption to surgical training during Covid-19 in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada and Australasia: a rapid review of impact and mitigation efforts	covid - 19 : a rapid scoping review	The global Covid-19 pandemic has the potential to lead to significant training disruptions affecting surgical residents across all specialties. There has been lively social media discussion about the impact of cancelled training activities under the twitter hashtag #NoTrainingTodayNoSurgeonsTomorrow. We present a rapid scoping review synthesising the current evidence of pandemic-related impact on surgical training in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. We describe and compare strategies that have been put in place to mitigate disruption, and reflect on how the challenges of the pandemic may present the opportunity to improve on how we select, assess and train surgeons in the future.
The role of integrated mental and community physical healthcare trusts in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK	integrated mental health services during the covid - 19 pandemic	For several decades, mental health services within the UK's National Health Service were provided by specialist mental health trusts. More recently many of these trusts have integrated community physical health services into their operations. We describe here how two integrated mental health trusts in England were able to make an enhanced response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Peripheral nerve lesion produces increased levels of major histocompatibility complex antigens in the central nervous system	microglia as a non - immunofluorescence of the central nervous system	Proliferation of central nervous system (CNS) glia in response to peripheral nerve injury occurs without apparent participation of cells of the immune system. It is shown here that following transection of the rat facial nerve there is strongly elevated expression of class I, and to a lesser extent, class II antigens of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) in the facial nucleus. It is demonstrated by double-immunofluorescence studies that the cells responsible for increased levels of MHC class I antigens are endogenous brain microglia. These findings emphasize the thought that microglia are immunocompetent cells, but, at the same time, raise the possibility for a non-immubological function of MHC antigens under conditions of neural regeneration.
COVID-19: The Current Situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo	covid - 19 pandemic : challenges and challenges	COVID-19 is a highly contagious disease that has affected all African countries including the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Formidable challenges limit precautionary measures which were instituted by the government to curb the pandemic. Insufficient COVID-19 testing laboratories, limited medical and personal protective equipment, and an inadequate number of health workers leave the country ill-equipped in the fight against the pandemic. Lack of assistance from the government to those who lost their jobs due to lockdown forced these individuals to go outside to find provisions, thus increasing the spread of the virus. Moreover, the fragile healthcare system is overburdened by civil conflicts and other epidemics and endemics amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The conflicts have led to thousands of deaths and hundreds of thousands of displacements and deprived many people of basic health services. The 11th outbreak of Ebola has been increasing at an alarming pace, and it is expected to soar because of a shortfall of funds and insufficient numbers of health workers. The DRC with the cooperation of regional powers needs to address these challenges in a manner similar to that used in the previous Ebola epidemics. Moreover, the government should have a balance in shifting the available resources between COVID-19 and other diseases. Until a vaccine is available, the DRC needs to be prudent when lifting restrictions to prevent explosion of new cases.
Analysis of complement deposition and viral RNA in placentas of COVID-19 patients	vascular thrombotic and microvascular injury syndrome in covid - 19 patients	COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel Coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, is increasingly being recognized as a systemic thrombotic and microvascular injury syndrome that may have its roots in complement activation. We had the opportunity to study the placental pathology of five full-term births to COVID-19 patients. All five exhibited histology indicative of fetal vascular malperfusion characterized by focal avascular villi and thrombi in larger fetal vessels. Vascular complement deposition in the placentas was not abnormal, and staining for viral RNA and viral spike protein was negative. While all cases resulted in healthy, term deliveries, these findings indicate the systemic nature of COVID-19 infection. The finding of vascular thrombosis without complement deposition may reflect the systemic nature of COVID-19's procoagulant effects unrelated to systemic complement activation.
Mathematical World Knowledge Contained in the Multilingual Wikipedia Project	a formula concept discovery : a case series	The purpose of this project is to test and evaluate an approach for Formula Concept Discovery (FCD). FCD aims at retrieving a formula concept (in the form of a Wikidata item) together with its defining formula within documents, in this case 100 English Wikipedia articles. To correctly identify the defining formula of a Wikipedia article, this approach searches for shared formulae across Wikipedia articles available in different languages. The formula shared in the most languages is then assumed to be the defining formula. The results show that neither this approach alone nor a combination with an existing approach that considers the order of the formulae inside an article leads to satisfying results. It is thus concluded that the number of times a formula is shared across a Wikipedia article in different languages is not a good indicator to determine the defining formula with the current approach. Consequently, several ideas for further research are proposed which could improve the results.
Telemedicine: Potential applications in epidemic situations	telemedicine as a potential tool for epidemics	Summary Background Telemedicine has several applications regarding different medical specialties or clinical situations. However, telemedicine as a potential tool during epidemics is not as well considered. Methods In this paper, the application of telemedicine is conceptualised using five possible evidence-based epidemic situations. Results The first situation corresponds to asymptomatic individuals, mainly home-based, living in an epidemic-affected location. The application of telemedicine would be through the use of teleconsultation for emergency medical dispatching and would occur when suspicious symptoms are detected by an individual. The second situation for the application of telemedicine is principally home-based and corresponds to the follow-up telemonitoring of asymptomatic individuals identified as case contacts. Concrete applications of these concepts were used during the Ebola virus disease outbreak in Africa since 2014. The third situation links to symptomatic cases in need of isolation. Examples include patients isolated in Taiwan during SARS epidemic in 2003 and H1N1 pandemic influenza in 2009, as well as H7N9 influenza infected patients in 2013 in China. The fourth situation involves tele-expertise when local medical resources do not have the technical expertise for the diagnosis or treatment of a patient and support is required from reference centres. The fifth situation corresponds to a healthcare facility under quarantine that would use telemedicine to keep taking care of patients that cannot access the facility, as it was the case in June 2015 in Seoul during the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus epidemic. Conclusion The use of telemedicine in epidemic situations has a high potential in improving epidemiological investigations, disease control, and clinical case management. However, since it is a recent application, further research would be needed to gain an improved understanding of how telemedicine could be applied in epidemic situations.
Longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis following acute COVID-19 infection	acute myelitis and covid - 19 : a case report	Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new illness caused by a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). With the increasing number of confirmed cases and the accumulating clinical data, a broad spectrum of neurological complications has been reported in the literature, including encephalopathy, stroke, Guillain-Barré syndrome, meningo-encephalitis, acute necrotizing hemorrhagic encephalopathy, and inflammatory central nervous system syndromes. Here, we describe the case of a 38-year-old woman presenting with longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis, revealed by bilateral lower limb weakness, decreased sensation below the Th4 level and urinary retention, and occuring 15 days after she had been diagnosed with COVID-19.
Synchronized Attachment and the Darwinian Evolution of Coronaviruses CoV-1 and CoV-2	a novel coronavirus infection	CoV2019 has evolved to be much more dangerous than CoV2003. Experiments suggest that structural rearrangements dramatically enhance CoV2019 activity. We identify a new first stage of infection which precedes structural rearrangements by using biomolecular evolutionary theory to identify sequence differences enhancing viral attachment rates. We find a small cluster of mutations which show that CoV-2 has a new feature that promotes much stronger viral attachment and enhances contagiousness. The extremely dangerous dynamics of human coronavirus infection is a dramatic example of evolutionary approach of self-organized networks to criticality. It may favor a very successful vaccine. The identified mutations can be used to test the present theory experimentally.
Anosmia and ageusia are emerging as symptoms in patients with COVID-19: What does the current evidence say?	anosmia and ageusia as potential symptoms of covid - 19	There have been several reports noting anosmia and ageusia as possible symptoms of COVID-19. This is of particular interest in oncology since patients receiving some cancer treatments such as chemotherapy or immune therapy often experience similar symptoms as side-effects. The purpose of this report was to summarise the evidence on the existence of anosmia and ageusia an emerging COVID-19 symptoms in order to better inform both oncology patients and clinicians. Currently, there is no published evidence or case reports noting anosmia or ageusia as symptoms of COVID-19. Nevertheless, experts in rhinology have suggested that the onset of such symptoms could either act as a trigger for testing for the disease where possible, or could be a new criterion to self-isolate. Whilst more data is currently needed to strengthen our knowledge of the symptoms of COVID-19, oncology patients who are concerned about anosmia or ageusia in the context of their systemic anti-cancer therapy should contact their acute oncology support line for advice.
Kawasaki disease shock syndrome or toxic shock syndrome in children and the relationship with COVID-19	severe inflammatory syndrome associated with covid - 19	Most pediatric patients with COVID-19 are asymptomatic or show only mild symptoms. However, in the last two months, first in Europe and recently in the United States, a small number of children have developed a more severe inflammatory syndrome associated with COVID-19, which often leads to hospitalization and sometimes requires intensive care A potential relationship was observed, especially between the occurrence of the Kawasaki disease and viral upper respiratory tract infections.
Management of complicated pediatric rhinosinusitis in the COVID-19 era	postoperative multidisciplinary treatment strategy for pediatric patients with covid - 19	With the ongoing development of the COVID-19 pandemic, research continues to emerge regarding the pathophysiology, characteristics, and treatment considerations for patients with COVID-19. No reports have highlighted the specific challenges posed in the management of pediatric patients with COVID-19 who present with complicated rhinosinusitis. In this report, we discuss our preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative multidisciplinary treatment strategy for these cases and provide two examples of complicated rhinosinusitis cases in COVID-19 patients, treated with two different approaches. Pearls, insights, and a brief review of the literature are discussed.
Make good use of big data: A home for everyone	a big data approach to improve the use of big data	The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic should teach us some lessons at health, environmental and human levels toward more fairness, human cohesion and environmental sustainability. At a health level, the pandemic raises the importance of housing for everyone particularly vulnerable and homeless people to protect them from the disease and against other similar airborne pandemics. Here, I propose to make good use of big data along with 3D construction printers to construct houses and solve some major and pressing housing needs worldwide. Big data can be used to determine how many people do need accommodation and 3D construction printers to build houses accordingly and swiftly. The combination of such facilities- big data and 3D printers- can help solve global housing crises more efficiently than traditional and unguided construction plans, particularly under environmental and major health crises where health and housing are tightly interrelated.
Tackling zoonoses in a crowded world: Lessons to be learned from the COVID-19 pandemic	the covid - 19 pandemic : a global perspective	The COVID-19 zoonosis is bringing about a number of lessons to humanity. One is that of transforming our links with nature and, particularly, wildlife given the likely COVID-19 origin from illegal wildlife trading. Similar to vector borne diseases (VBD, diseases transmitted by vectors), the COVID-19 pandemic follows related patterns (e.g. no effective or available vaccines, difficult to diagnose, highly localized infection geographical foci, non-human reservoirs) for which we urgently need preventive measures. Towards this aim, governments worldwide must strive to prevent further devastation of natural environments that serve as buffer areas to humans against zoonotic agents (among other health risks), protecting biodiversity and its concomitant causes (e.g. global change), and banning use of wildlife of illegal origin. We herein state that some VBD prevention strategies could also be applied to zoonotic disease prevention, including COVID-19 or any type likely to be related to environmental conditions. The occurrence of future pandemic occurrence will depend on whether governments embrace these aims now.
Wastewater Virus Detection Complements Clinical COVID-19 Testing to Limit Spread of Infection at Kenyon College	wastewater surveillance during the covid - 19 pandemic	In-person college instruction during the 2020 pandemic required effective and economical monitoring of COVID-19 prevalence. Kenyon College and the Village of Gambier conducted measurement of SARS-CoV-2 RNA from the village wastewater plant and from an on-campus sewer line. Wastewater RNA detection revealed virus prevalence leading to individual testing and case identification. Wastewater surveillance also showed when case rates had subsided, thus limiting the need for individual clinical testing. Overall, wastewater virus surveillance allows more targeted use of individual testing and increases community confidence in student population management.
Development of immunoglobulin G enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for the serodiagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome	immunoglobulin g ( igg ) enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay for sars - associated coronavirus	Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an emerging infectious disease caused by a novel SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV). The clinical characteristics are high fever, rapidly progressive diffuse pneumonitis and respiratory distress. It is highly infectious through intimate contact or direct contact with infectious body fluids. Outbreaks within communities and hospitals have been reported. Development of rapid and reliable diagnostic tools is urgently needed. We developed an immunoglobulin G (IgG) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), using whole virus antigen of SARS-CoV. Eighty-six serum samples collected from patients who were hospitalized for other causes were examined to determine the cut-off O.D. value. The cut-off O.D. value was defined as 0.175 by calculating the mean O.D. value of the 86 sera plus 3 standard deviations. To determine the sensitivity and specificity of the ELISA, 56 positive sera and 204 negative sera were tested. The sensitivity was 96.4% and the specificity was 100%. The results suggest that the IgG ELISA using whole virus antigen of SARS-CoV has a high sensitivity and specificity in detecting SARS IgG antibodies. This IgG ELISA is a powerful tool for serodiagnosis of SARS.
Extreme risk spillover between Chinese and global crude oil futures	the risk spillover between chinese and international traditional chinese and international commercial oil markets	This paper investigates the risk spillover between China's crude oil futures and international crude oil futures by constructing upside and downside VaR connectedness networks. The findings show that China's crude oil futures behave as a net risk receiver in the global crude oil system, in which Brent and WTI play the leading roles in risk transmission in the system. The dynamic results indicate that the risk spillover between Chinese and international crude oil futures presents obvious time-varying characteristics and has risen sharply since the beginning of 2020, induced by the COVID-19 pandemic.
The Professional Quality of Life and Work Engagement of Nurse Leaders	the nursing group : a case report of the nurses's experience	Even before the current pandemic, the nurse leader (NL) role was demanding of time, energy, and resources. These demands often cause stress, fatigue, and burnout. The focused-on outcome metrics, increased regulations, and economic downturn are challenges that NLs have continued to face. This study, undertaken before the pandemic, provides understanding of the professional quality of life and work engagement among NLs. Findings revealed that experienced NLs with doctorates have higher levels of compassion satisfaction and engagement, and have lowest levels of burnout and secondary traumatic stress. Minimizing compassion fatigue among NLs is imperative as they foster organizational cultures of compassion and engagement. Future research post-pandemic is recommended, especially as the demands have increased significantly.
Global Health Security: The Lessons from the West African Ebola Virus Disease Epidemic and MERS Outbreak in the Republic of Korea	global health security in the republic of korea	The Ebola virus disease outbreak in West Africa and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome outbreak in the Republic of Korea have given huge impacts in different aspects. Health security is no more a new coinage. Global health security became more realistic in its practical application. In the perspective of global health, it will be helpful to peruse lessons learned from the Ebola outbreak in West Africa and MERS outbreak in Korea.
Emerging challenges in meeting physiotherapy needs during COVID-19 through telerehabilitation	telerehabilitation in the face of covid - 19 : a case report	BACKGROUND: Physiotherapy plays a significant role in rehabilitation. However, the emergence of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has posed a big challenge to its practice, especially regarding the level of contact with patients. There is a dire need for the exploration of rehabilitation options, other than in-person contacts, to limit the spread of the virus. This article explores telerehabilitation, its outcomes, and the challenges involved in the continuum of care of patients by physiotherapists in the face of the pandemic. BODY: Telerehabilitation is a vital tool which utilizes technology to link practitioners to patients. With its previous history of favorable outcomes for the rehabilitation of certain conditions, telerehabilitation has been widely recommended. However, issues exist on how well it can bridge the gap of physical touch in physiotherapy, its effectiveness in terms of outcomes and satisfaction across various conditions and large population sizes, and finally, its cost and effects, especially in developing countries. CONCLUSION: Telerehabilitation is a necessary adaptation to ensure continued physiotherapy service delivery during the pandemic. However, more quality studies are recommended to evaluate its effectiveness and outcomes. Also, measures to ensure that developing countries are catered for in meeting the rising demands for physiotherapy services using telerehabilitation should be carried out.
A Rare Case of SARS-CoV-2 Infection Associated With Pituitary Apoplexy Without Comorbidities	a case report : a case report of a patient with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection	Pituitary apoplexy is a medical and surgical emergency caused by hemorrhage or infarction of the hypophysis, which typically occurs within a pituitary adenoma. It is usually characterized by severe (often thunderclap) headache, visual disturbances, cranial nerve impairments, and hormonal deficiencies. We herein report a case of a previously healthy woman with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection associated with pituitary apoplexy. The plausible pathophysiological mechanisms of pituitary apoplexy in infectious coronavirus disease 2019 are discussed.
Surgical management of spontaneous post-partum bladder rupture in an Amazonian emergency hospital	a case report of a case report of the urinary kidney in a emergency hospital in a emergency hospital in a tertiary care hospital in a tertiary care hospital in a tertiary care hospital in a tertiary care hospital in a tertiary care hospital in a tertiary care hospital in a tertiary care hospital in a tertiary care hospital in a tertiary care hospital in a tertiary care hospital in a tertiary care hospital in a tertiary care hospital in a tertiary care hospital in a tertiary care hospital in a tertiary care hospital in a tertiary care	Spontaneous rupture of the urinary bladder (SRUB) is a rare urological emergency and even more uncommon in the puerperium. Post-partum bladder rupture might be associated with fetal pressure on the not emptied bladder wall during labor. We report a case of SRUB three days after normal vaginal delivery with high values of creatinine and absence of hematuria, surgically managed in an emergency hospital in the Amazon.
Advances of bioinformatics tools applied in virus epitopes prediction	prediction of viruses	In recent years, the in silico epitopes prediction tools have facilitated the progress of vaccines development significantly and many have been applied to predict epitopes in viruses successfully. Herein, a general overview of different tools currently available, including T cell and B cell epitopes prediction tools, is presented. And the principles of different prediction algorithms are reviewed briefly. Finally, several examples are present to illustrate the application of the prediction tools.
Mediastinal Emphysema, Giant Bulla, and Pneumothorax Developed during the Course of COVID-19 Pneumonia	covid - 19 pneumonia : a case report	The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia is a recent outbreak in mainland China and has rapidly spread to multiple countries worldwide. Pulmonary parenchymal opacities are often observed during chest radiography. Currently, few cases have reported the complications of severe COVID-19 pneumonia. We report a case where serial follow-up chest computed tomography revealed progression of pulmonary lesions into confluent bilateral consolidation with lower lung predominance, thereby confirming COVID-19 pneumonia. Furthermore, complications such as mediastinal emphysema, giant bulla, and pneumothorax were also observed during the course of the disease.
Self-Assessment Questionnaire for Efficient and Safe Evaluation of Patients with Mild COVID-19	a self - assessment questionnaire for patients with coronavirus disease 2019	As the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 continues and the number of confirmed cases requiring isolation increases, there is a need for a safe and efficient system to assess patients' condition. We developed and evaluated a self-assessment questionnaire consisting of 23 symptoms with linear-scale scores from 0 to 10. Patients were asked to indicate their worst score for each symptom daily, and medical personnel assessed clinical improvement or deterioration based on the changes in scores. Focused communication on severity of specific symptoms was the primary advantage for the clinicians, and a thorough check for their symptoms was helpful for patients.
Resumption of Elective Surgery Following COVID-19 Outbreak, Guideline for Female Pelvic Medicine and Surgery	decision making in a patient with covid - 19 pandemic : a clinically related approach	Division of Female Pelvic Medicine and Surgery, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Emam Khomeini Hospital, Tehran University of medical sciences proposed a clinically relevant algorithm to guide appropriate decision making based on underlying risk stratification and resource utilization in order to resume elective surgeries, following COVID-19 pandemic crisis. The consequence of standardized decision-making factors and transparency of the principles will provide more assurance, consistency, and reliability on both sides, care providers and the patient. It also will decrease ethical dilemmas and moral criticism for surgeons. Eventually, this approach is applicable in any other disaster preparedness as a logical stratification of surgical indications for the female pelvic floor surgical procedures.
Clinicopathologic and Immunohistochemical Findings from Autopsy of Patient with COVID-19, Japan	severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 antigen in alveolar epithelial cells	An autopsy of a patient in Japan with coronavirus disease indicated pneumonia lung pathology, manifested as diffuse alveolar damage. We detected severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 antigen in alveolar epithelial cells and macrophages. Coronavirus disease is essentially a lower respiratory tract disease characterized by direct viral injury of alveolar epithelial cells.
Comprehensive analysis of COVID-19 during pregnancy	maternal antibody response to sars - cov - 2 in pregnancy : a review	The COVID-19 pandemic resulting from the emergence of the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 remains a major global health concern. Pregnant individuals are more likely to develop severe COVID-19 and a number of pregnancy complications have been observed in COVID-19 patients. To date, little is known about the impact of COVID-19 on pregnancy. In this review, we examine key aspects of pregnancy that may be impacted by COVID-19 and summarize the current literature on SARS-CoV-2 infection of the placenta and in utero vertical transmission. Furthermore, we highlight recent studies exploring the role of the maternal antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 during pregnancy and the passive transfer of maternal antibodies from mothers with COVID-19 to fetus.
Early percutaneous tracheotomy in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and infection in healthcare personnel: a cohort study	exposure to early percutaneous tracheotomy and increased risk of sars - cov - 2 infection	The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between exposure to early percutaneous tracheotomy and increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection for personnel involved in the procedure. No association was found, infection rate was similar between operators exposed and not exposed to the procedure, therefore percutaneous tracheotomy seems safe for the staff involved.

The goal of this project is improve the ranking in legal IR systems. Ultimately, this will help legal professionals find relevant information faster.
Splenic Abscess: An Unusual Presentation of COVID-19?	splenic abscess and pneumoperitoneum in a patient with covid - 19	Most patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) present with respiratory symptoms that range from mild symptoms to severe illness leading to mortality. Some might be asymptomatic and others may present with unusual presentations. A 55-year-old male with a past history of ischemic stroke, ischemic heart disease, and type 2 diabetes mellitus presented with right-sided weakness and a history of abdominal pain, diarrhea, and fever. He tested positive for COVID-19. Computed tomography (CT) abdomen showed the presence of splenic abscess and small intraperitoneal gas indicating pneumoperitoneum. Laparotomy revealed ruptured splenic abscess and splenectomy was done. The patient continued to show features of severe sepsis with multiorgan failure and died on postoperative day 16. COVID-19 mainly affects the respiratory system but extrapulmonary affection has been reported. Direct invasion and damage to the organs by the virus could be the reason behind the development of the extrapulmonary manifestations.
How to get out: ssRNA enveloped viruses and membrane fission	the role of escrt - dependent membrane on membrane transport	Enveloped viruses acquire their membrane from the host cell and accordingly need to separate their envelope from cellular membranes via membrane fission. Although some of the enveloped viruses recruit the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) to catalyze the final fission reaction, many enveloped viruses seem to bud in an ESCRT-independent manner. Here we describe the principles that govern membrane fission reactions in general and review progress in the understanding of ESCRT-mediated membrane fission. We relate ESCRT function to budding of single stranded RNA viruses and discuss alternative ways to mediate membrane fission that may govern ESCRT-independent budding.
Influence of clinical characteristics and anti-cancer therapy on outcomes from SARS-CoV-2 infection: a systematic review and meta-analysis of 5,678 cancer patients	risk factors for death in cancer patients with covid - 19 : a meta - analysis	Background The COVID-19 pandemic started a healthcare crisis and heavily impacted cancer services. Methods Data from cohort studies of COVID-19 cancer patients published up until October 23rd 2020 from PubMed, PubMed Central, medRxiv and Google Scholar were reviewed. Meta-analyses using the random effects model was performed to assess the risk of death in cancer patients with COVID-19. Results Our meta-analyses including up to 5,678 patients from 13 studies showed that the following were all statistically significant risk factors for death following SARS-CoV-2 infection in cancer patients: age of 65 and above, presence of co-morbidities, cardiovascular disease, chronic lung disease, diabetes and hypertension. There was no evidence that patients who had received cancer treatment within 60 days of their COVID-19 diagnosis were at a higher risk of death, including patients who had recent chemotherapy. Conclusions Cancer patients are susceptible to severe COVID-19, especially older patients and patients with co-morbidities who will require close monitoring. Our findings support the continued administration of anti-cancer therapy during the pandemic. The analysis of chemotherapy was powered at 70% to detect an effect size of 1.2 but all other anti-cancer treatments had lower power. Further studies are required to better estimate their impact on the outcome of cancer patients.
A Deep Language-independent Network to analyze the impact of COVID-19 on the World via Sentiment Analysis	a deep language - independent multilevel attention - based conv - bigru network ( macbig - net )	Towards the end of 2019, Wuhan experienced an outbreak of novel coronavirus, which soon spread all over the world, resulting in a deadly pandemic that infected millions of people around the globe. The government and public health agencies followed many strategies to counter the fatal virus. However, the virus severely affected the social and economic lives of the people. In this paper, we extract and study the opinion of people from the top five worst affected countries by the virus, namely USA, Brazil, India, Russia, and South Africa. We propose a deep language-independent Multilevel Attention-based Conv-BiGRU network (MACBiG-Net), which includes embedding layer, word-level encoded attention, and sentence-level encoded attention mechanism to extract the positive, negative, and neutral sentiments. The embedding layer encodes the sentence sequence into a real-valued vector. The word-level and sentence-level encoding is performed by a 1D Conv-BiGRU based mechanism, followed by word-level and sentence-level attention, respectively. We further develop a COVID-19 Sentiment Dataset by crawling the tweets from Twitter. Extensive experiments on our proposed dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MACBiG-Net. Also, attention-weights visualization and in-depth results analysis shows that the proposed network has effectively captured the sentiments of the people.

Adaptations are necessary to continue clinical care, education, and research, while minimising the risk of infection of our staff and students. Here, we report our early experience in response to the challenge posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. The Translational Potential of this Article This perspective can help to disseminate knowledge from an orthopaedic unit in a university hospital on overcoming the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic, including clinical practice, education of medical students, and research.
Diabetic retinopathy is independently associated with increased risk of intubation: a single centre cohort study of patients with diabetes hospitalised with COVID-19	covid - 19 and the role of microangiopathy in patients with diabetes hospitalised with diabetic retinopathy	In our study of 187 patients with diabetes hospitalised with COVID-19 we observed a more than 5 fold increased risk of intubation in patients with diabetic retinopathy. Further studies are required to understand the mechanisms that explain the associations between retinopathy and other indices of microangiopathy with severe COVID-19.
Impact of meteorological parameters on the Covid-19 incidence. The case of the city of Oran, Algeria.	covid - 19 in the city of oran : a case report	Several studies have confirmed the impact of weather conditions on the evolution of the Covid-19 pandemic. We wanted to verify this phenomenon in the city of Oran in Algeria, which experienced its first case of Covid19 on March 19, 2020. The data studied are the new Covid19 cases, the average, minimum and maximum temperatures, as well as the relative humidity rate. A first analysis of the data with a Spearman rank correlation test did not yield significant results. Taking into account the average incubation period to adjust the data made it possible, during a second analysis, to show that the minimum temperature is significantly correlated with the new cases of Covid19 in Oran. This study can help establish prevention policies against Covid19, especially during fall in temperatures in autumn and winter.
Russia between east and west, and the future of Eurasian order	global and local change : a new order - making region	This article introduces the special issue by going beyond the traditional debates about geopolitics and great power rivalry. Instead, it examines the emergent and highly complex world of Central Eurasia, in its transformative effort to reorder itself in response to both global and local change. In particular, the paper (and the volume) focuses on two interrelated themes: one of a changing Russia, that is anxiously trying to adapt to the uncertain dynamics within and beyond the wider Eurasian space; and the other—of an emerging complexity of new order-making regional (integration) initiatives that are poised to reshape the future of international and global order. The overarching intention of this paper and the volume is to advance the need to focus on ‘the local’, to gain a more holistic understanding of the present-day challenges and the kind of global response needed to stay attuned to the increasingly complex world.

Bio-compatible medical implants will have a huge clinical impact.
Utilization of telemedicine in rhinologic practice during COVID-19 pandemic	applicability and feasibility of telemedicine in rhinology patients with covid - 19	BACKGROUND: The only two preventive interventions available for COVID-19 have been social distancing and quarantine. These preventive measures challenge health care providers by causing cancelations of elective in-person outpatient clinic visits in many hospitals, particularly in otolaryngology clinics. OBJECTIVES: To assess the applicability and feasibility of telemedicine in rhinology cases with a study of outcomes to guide rhinologists on indications of in-office visits. Assessment of patient satisfaction with telemedicine in the rhinology clinic was also investigated. METHODS: A retrospective review of electronic charts of all adult patients (>18 years) who were scheduled in the rhinology clinics of King Abdulaziz University Hospital, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, and received a phone call as a part of telemedicine care from April through June 2020. Demographics (including age and gender), diagnosis, plan of treatment, and status of the visit (either new or follow-up) were collected. In addition, we used a special questionnaire to measure the satisfaction rate among patients who received telemedicine services. RESULTS: A total of 339 patients were included. The mean age was 41 years with 60.2% males. Only 5 cases (1.48%) were asked to attend to the clinic. The vast majority of cases were given a follow-up (n = 311, 91.7%). The most common diagnosis among the follow-up cases was chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (n = 130, 38.3%). The satisfaction telephone survey had a total of 41 respondents out of 80 cases selected randomly. Most respondents (83.3%) were satisfied with telemedicine services. CONCLUSION: We conclude that telemedicine proved its effectiveness in the efficient management and screening of rhinology cases during public health emergencies while providing sufficient protection for patients and medical practitioners. Telemedicine as a modality of care during the pandemic faced minor or no opposition given patients' understanding of the importance of social distancing.
COVID-19 and Thyroid: Progress and Prospects	covid - 19 infection and thyroid dysfunction : a review	The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has rapidly spread worldwide. A number of serious effects on various organs and systems have been reported in humans, and recently emerging evidence on the potential association between the infection and thyroid dysfunction are attracting attention from the scientific community. This editorial critically summarizes the main findings on this topic published so far and defines research lines according to the translational approach from the bench to the bed to epidemiological studies and back again, aimed at patient care and effective public health measures.
Travel, Migration and Emerging Infectious Diseases	emerging infectious diseases and emerging infectious diseases	Emerging infectious diseases (EID) threaten public health and are sustained by increasing global commerce, travel and disruption of ecological systems. Travelers could play a role in importing EIDs and could be a sentinel of major epidemics. In connection with the extension of poverty, urbanization, extensive livestock rearing and globalization, we could be exposed to a third epidemiological transition characterized by zoonotic diseases and infections with multidrug-resistant bacteria. The risk appears low for emerging infectious diseases, or very low for high-risk emerging infectious diseases, but higher for multidrug-resistant enterobacteriaceae carriage with possibly limited consequences. The role played by migrants is weaker than imagined. Immigrants don’t play the role of sentinel epidemic so far. They could play a role in importing multidrug-resistant enterobacteriaceae, but it is poorly evaluated.
Reducing the Fatality Rate of COVID-19 by Applying Clinical Insights From Immuno-Oncology and Lung Transplantation	covid - 19 : insights and lessons learned from clinical immune - oncology trials	There is an urgent need to identify effective strategies that can stop or reverse the inflammatory process that causes acute lung injury, ARDS, and multi-organ failure in COVID-19. Adaptive clinical trials with parallel enrollment to different arms each evaluating a rationally designed combination modality could provide the foundation for the accelerated identification of effective and safe multi-modality treatment algorithms for COVID-19 pneumonia. This article summarizes the insights and lessons learned from clinical immune-oncology trials as well as lung transplantation that are informing the clinical development of promising new strategies aimed at reducing the fatality rate in COVID-19.
Acute pancreatitis and nosocomial COVID-19: Cause specific host responses may determine lung injury	severe acute pancreatitis with severe acute pancreatitis	BACKGROUND: /ObjectivesCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) presents with myriad extra-pulmonary manifestation and a high mortality in patients with comorbidities. Its effect on patients with pre-existing severe acute pancreatitis is not known. METHODS: We hereby, present 3 cases with severe acute pancreatitis with persistent respiratory failure who acquired nosocomial COVID-19 during their hospital stay after recovery from respiratory failure. Their clinical course is highlighted which might reflect on pathophysiology of organ dysfunction. RESULTS: None of the 3 patients with severe acute pancreatitis who developed nosocomial COVID-19 redeveloped respiratory failure suggestive of severe COVID-19 despite having recently recovered from pancreatitis induced acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. Only one patient had SARS-CoV2 induced moderate pneumonia. CONCLUSION: These cases highlight that host responses and mechanisms of lung injury might be different in severe pancreatitis and COVID-19.
Stroke and Telerehabilitation: A Brief Communication	telerehabilitation in stroke : a rapid communication report	This rapid communication highlights stroke telerehabilitation, a health care service that provides daily monitoring of the care of patients recovering from stroke, delivering convenient and immediate feedback for patients, family, and caregivers. The delivery, management, and coordination of nursing care services, provided via telecommunications technology, is a convenient method of delivering health care to patients recovering from stroke. It is important to assess the service quality of the telehealth process and to establish the role of telehealth nursing and related technologies in the care of patients recovering from stroke. Studies show that even though both health professionals and participants have reported high levels of satisfaction and acceptance of telerehabilitation interventions, the quality of the evidence on telerehabilitation in poststroke care remains low. Conducting a quality study of telehealth rehabilitation for patients recovering from stroke will help assess if home health agencies with telehealth capabilities caring for patients recovering from stroke and patients with chronic diseases can provide quality care to patients in their home and fill this health care gap. Patients that are severely handicapped and impaired and unable to reside in their home environment are not included in telerehabilitation services provided by the home care agency. It would be informative to study the benefits of telerehabilitation and the care provided to patients recovering from stroke within nursing homes, given the need for social distancing to reduce disease transmission during the current coronavirus disease (COVID-19) global health pandemic. Using telerehabilitation would mean that patients have a lower risk of exposure to infectious agents. Further research into telehealth interventions and stroke management in home care is crucial.
